To create a system that will automate some of the daily tasks using python. I am thinking of applying it to the website rateyourmusic.com, specifically the charts section, where you can easily find all the options and then genre the list of the albums, eps and etc. I think that the user should input everything that he or she wants and then 

Explanation of the task

During the development of the project, you should use GitHub, where you will publish not only the program code, but also the necessary software documentation.

When developing a project, you need to create a README.md file where you (MANDATORY in Latvian):

· you will describe the project task in detail;

· you will explain which Python libraries are used during project development and why

· methods of using the software will be described

All changes in the development of the project are stored in a GitHub repository, which allows you to track the progress of the development of the project.
