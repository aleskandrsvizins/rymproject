To create a system that will automate some of the daily tasks using python. I am thinking of applying it to the website rateyourmusic.com, specifically the charts section, where you can easily find all the options and then genre the list of the albums, eps and etc. I think that the user should input everything that he or she wants and then 

Since software development is rarely a one-person endeavor, you are given the opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates during the development of this final project. Of course, each student in any such group is expected to participate equally in the development of the group project. Additionally, a two- or three-person group project is expected to be twice or three times larger, respectively, than a single-person project.

Explanation of the task

During the development of the project, you should use GitHub, where you will publish not only the program code, but also the necessary software documentation.

When developing a project, you need to create a README.md file where you (MANDATORY in Latvian):

· you will describe the project task in detail;

· you will explain which Python libraries are used during project development and why

· methods of using the software will be described

A video can be attached (link to it) that will show your software in action and the result.

If you don't have experience with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub Basics Writing and Formatting helpful.

README files for a standard software project can often run into the thousands or even tens of thousands of words. Your file doesn't have to be that big, but there should be at least several hundred words describing the project in detail!

All changes in the development of the project are stored in a GitHub repository, which allows you to track the progress of the development of the project.
